# Agriculture-Supply-Chain-Management

#### This repository contains code for an Agricultural Suppy Chain Management DApp using *Solidity* and *Truffle*. The backend is deployed on Truffle and interactions are made using web3.js. 

## Traditional farming-transport challenges
 * Outdated traditional delivery practices
 * Adulterated food quality
 * Price inflation due to middle-men intervention
 * Delayed Payments/ unpaid contracts and lack of trust between both parties


## Why agri-chain?
* It provides trancparency between the farmers and customers
* Keeps a record of transactions
* Solves the problems of price-inflation/ food-adulteration that occurs due to involvement of middle-men
* The payment is automated and is kept stored under the contract address and is released only after a confirmation from the customer

## Tech Stacks

* [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)
* [Ganache (for local deployment)](https://trufflesuite.com/)
